*This project is currently in progress.*

Dalton allows pcaps to be run against sundry IDS sensors (e.g. Suricata, Snort) and sensor versions using a defined ruleset and/or bespoke rules.

To see it in action, run:

`docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`

Then navigate to http://<docker-host>/dalton/
